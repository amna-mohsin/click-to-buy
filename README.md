# Click-to-Buy

A **beginner-friendly JavaScript project** that simulates an e-commerce "Add to Cart" feature. Clicking on a product's **Add to Cart** button displays the original price and applies a discount to selected items.

This project is ideal for learning basic **JavaScript concepts**, including arrays, conditional statements, and DOM interaction, with a simple and clean UI.

## Features

* **Product List** — Multiple products stored in a JavaScript array.
* **Discount Application** — Applies a 10% discount to a specific product.
* **Interactive Alerts** — Shows original and discounted prices when adding to cart.
* **Client-Side Only** — Fully functional in the browser without backend support.
* **Simple & Responsive UI** — Easy to understand and visually presentable.

## Technologies Used

* HTML5
* CSS3
* JavaScript (DOM Manipulation & Conditional Logic)

## Project Overview

* **Product Cards** — Each product has a name, image, price, and Add to Cart button.
* **Discount Logic** — A specific product (e.g., AeroFlash) receives a 10% discount.
* **Add to Cart Interaction** — Alerts show original and discounted prices only when the button is clicked.
